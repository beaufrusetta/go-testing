# Beau's Go Testing
This is my main "testing" directory for my Golang exploration. Currently not working on anything super awesome, however, I'm reading about Golang like it's my job. ;-)

## Books I'm Currently Reading
Here are some books that I'm currently reading as a part of my current Go learning process.

* [The Go Programming Language](http://www.gopl.io/)
* [Go in Action](https://www.manning.com/books/go-in-action)
* [Go in Practice](https://www.manning.com/books/go-in-practice)

## Projects
This is a list of projects I'd like to find and/or work on in Golang. This is mostly stuff I find generally interesting.

* Home Automation
* Blogging Platform (Wordpress Style)
